    ```

2. **Total Pizzas Sold:**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold FROM pizza_sales;
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Average_Order_Value FROM pizza_sales;
    ```

### Trends:
1. **Monthly Trend for Orders:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DATENAME(month, order_date) AS Month_Name, 
           COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders 
    FROM pizza_sales 
    GROUP BY DATENAME(month, order_date) 
    ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC;
    ```

### Sales Breakdown:
1. **Total Pizzas Sold by Category:**
    ```sql
